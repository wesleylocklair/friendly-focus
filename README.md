# friendly-Focus

## Desciption
This app was created as a the server side of a social media platform. The goal of this application is to be able to create a user. The users can post thoughts and react on their friends thoughts. This app uses MongoDB and CRUD operations to create,post,sort,update and delete the users, thoughts, and reactions! Hopefully in the future this app can be converted into a user interactable interface! As of right now this application is not deployed.

## Usage
To use this app I have Mongo DB running in my main terminal. Second you can use insomnia to send http requests. Look at the different routes each for users and for thoughts. This will create the corresponding category by what you choose. To create either, you need to have a body of JSON that goes to the corresponding categories.
